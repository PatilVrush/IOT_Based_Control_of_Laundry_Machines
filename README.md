# IOT_Based_Control_of_Laundry_Machines
Proposed and implemented a novel algorithm to control existing old laundry machines using smart phones and computers. Designed a custom PCB and Web-App for the hostel laundromats. University students can now check availability of machines from a distant place and also if their machine cycles are complete or no. Studied the internal hardware of the machines responsible for activation and status information and designed the PCB accordingly.

PCB SCHEMATICS AND WEB APP CODE CANNOT BE SHARED DUE TO SECURITY REASONS.
