# IOT_Based_Control_of_Laundry_Machines
We proposed and implemented a novel algorithm to control existing old laundry machines using smart phones and computers. We designed a custom PCB and Web-App for the hostel laundromats. University students can now check availability of machines from a distant place and also if their machine cycles are complete or not.
